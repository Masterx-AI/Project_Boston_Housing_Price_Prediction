### Description:
Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston
The medv variable is the target variable. \
The Boston data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns.

**This data frame contains the following columns:**
* crim --> per capita crime rate by town.
* zn --> proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
* indus --> proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
* chas --> Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
* nox --> nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
* rm --> average number of rooms per dwelling.
* age --> proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
* dis --> weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
* rad --> index of accessibility to radial highways.
* tax --> full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.
* ptratio --> pupil-teacher ratio by town.
* black --> 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
* lstat --> lower status of the population (percent).
* medv --> median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s.

### Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
- Build Regression models to predict the sales w.r.t a single & multiple feature.
- Also evaluate the models & compare thier respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.

### Here are some of the key outcomes of the project:
- The Dataset was quiet small totally just 506 samples & after preprocessing 8.1% of the datasamples were dropped. 
- Visualising the distribution of data & their relationships, helped us to get some insights on the feature-set.
- The features had high multicollinearity, hence in Feature Extraction step, we used VIF & RFE Techniques to drop highly correlated features.
- Testing multiple algorithms with default hyperparamters gave us some understanding for various models performance on this specific dataset.
- While, Polynomial Regression (Order-2) gave the best overall scores for the current dataset, yet it wise to also consider simpler models like MLR & ENR as they are more generalisable.
